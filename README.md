# Cross-feeding

#### Introduction
This is a simulator for studying the cross-feeding mechanism based on kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. The code written in C++ and it supports compiling in multiple platform. 

#### Get Started
1. Compiling the simulator:
```bash
make <model-type>
```
There are four types of model types offered:
```
1. commensalism
2. syntrophy
3. mutualism
4. mutualism-tox
```
To access the debug mode add `-d` at the end of each type, as following:
```
1. commensalism-d
2. syntrophy-d
3. mutualism-d
4. mutualism-tox-d
```
Note that all compiled simulators are output to the subfolder `bin/` with the same name as the `<model-type>`, access [here](./bin/)

2. To start the simulation, use the following shell command:
```bash
./bin/<model-type> <parameter> <number-output-files> <output-directory>
```
Parameter description:
| Parameter Name          | Description                                           |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `<model-type>`          | Type of the model used                                |
| `<parameter>`           | Directory to parameter files                          |
| `<number-output-files>` | Number of output files, having the same time interval |ÃŸ
| `<output-directory>`    | Directory stores all output files                     |

3. To access the output files, go to the `<output-directory>` specified in previous step. Note that:
   1. All output files are three $n\times n$ matrices representing lattices of the colony and nutrient profiles.
      1. Colony are integers: 0 represents empty, 1 and 2 represent two types of species
      2. Nutrient are floating numbers representing the amount of nutrient produced in each lattice.
   2. Output files are in the format of `.txt` file, which can be easily accessed using common programming language.
